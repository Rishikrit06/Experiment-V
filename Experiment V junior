School is boring but I like hanging out with friends.
I wish that we could go somewhere for the 4 day weekend.
Life is so uneventful
I need to get money from the people that owe me.
I wish there was something fun to do.
BUt the good thing is is that i'm going to Christians house for a sleepover.
I hope I can get through this stupid test.
I really want to go to Christians house for the sleepover.
